## Pull Request Process

Pull requests are welcome and pair well with bug reports and feature requests. Here are some tips to follow before submitting your first PR:

- Fork the repository to your own account if you haven't already.
- Use [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org) or at least stay consistent to the file formats defined in the `.editorconfig` file.
- Develop in a fix or feature branch (`fix/describe-your-fix`, `feature/describe-your-feature`), not in `main` or `develop`.
- The pre-commit hook will cover some tasks, but be sure to run `npm run format` before staging your commits.
- Make your changes in your fork.
- Validate your chances according to the [Yospace Validation Procedure](https://developer.yospace.com/sdk-documentation/javascript/userguide/latest/en/validate-your-app.html).
- Add an entry to the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) file in the `[Unreleased]` section to describe the changes to the project. Can be done manually or using `npx kacl`.
- Submit a pull request to the main repository.

The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).

All additions, modifications and fixes that are submitted will be reviewed. The project owners reserve the right to reject any pull request that does not meet our standards. We may not be able to respond to all pull requests immediately and provide no timeframes to do so.
